a skilled and reliable Unity developer to create a polished and functional 3D roulette game for Android. The project involves both the visual creation of the roulette interface and the integration of a custom spin algorithm Minimum 5 algorithm. (not purely random). Total 0-31 - 32 numbers. Option 1- Play with me. Option-2- I will play. ( First system will match the players , If Play with me user is not available online. Game will be transfer to computer for i want to play users ) One player who will play with all other player in a session and will pay 30 times ( Points) for a winning number. Example- One play will play with all other player a random algorithm will be applied to the game and algorithm will be changed after a particular time. So that no one crack the algorithm. 🔧 Key Features: Fully animated 3D roulette wheel with realistic spin with admob rewarded ads.

---------------
Here’s a scoped and actionable Unity development plan and starter script architecture for your 3D Android Roulette game with multiplayer fallback and custom spin algorithm logic.
✅ Key System Architecture Overview
🎮 Game Modes

🧠 Spin Algorithm Interface Example

public interface ISpinAlgorithm {
    int GetWinningNumber(List<int> recentSpins);
}

public class WeightedAlgorithm : ISpinAlgorithm {
    public int GetWinningNumber(List<int> recentSpins) {
        // Favor cold numbers (not drawn recently)
        Dictionary<int, int> weights = new Dictionary<int, int>();
        for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++) weights[i] = 1;

        foreach (int recent in recentSpins.TakeLast(10))
            weights[recent] /= 2; // penalize recent hits

        int totalWeight = weights.Values.Sum();
        int roll = UnityEngine.Random.Range(0, totalWeight);

        foreach (var pair in weights) {
            if (roll < pair.Value) return pair.Key;
            roll -= pair.Value;
        }

        return UnityEngine.Random.Range(0, 32);
    }
}

Switch between algorithms using:

public class SpinManager : MonoBehaviour {
    private List<ISpinAlgorithm> algorithms;
    private ISpinAlgorithm current;
    private float switchTimer = 60f;
    private float elapsedTime = 0f;

    void Start() {
        algorithms = new List<ISpinAlgorithm> {
            new WeightedAlgorithm(),
            new RandomBiasAlgorithm(),
            new HotStreakAlgorithm(),
            new EvenerAlgorithm(),
            new DelayedRepeatAlgorithm()
        };
        current = algorithms[UnityEngine.Random.Range(0, algorithms.Count)];
    }

    void Update() {
        elapsedTime += Time.deltaTime;
        if (elapsedTime >= switchTimer) {
            current = algorithms[UnityEngine.Random.Range(0, algorithms.Count)];
            elapsedTime = 0;
        }
    }

    public int GetSpinResult(List<int> history) => current.GetWinningNumber(history);
}

🧩 Multiplayer Logic

    Unity with Mirror or Photon for real-time match-up.

    On "Play with Me", wait in a lobby.

    If no match in X seconds → switch to CPU and play instantly with the current algorithm.

    CPU "bets" aren't shown; only your interaction matters.

🧠 Core Scripts Overview
1. SpinManager.cs

Manages the roulette wheel's spinning mechanics and integrates the custom spin algorithms.

public class SpinManager : MonoBehaviour {
    private ISpinAlgorithm currentAlgorithm;
    private List<int> recentSpins = new List<int>();

    void Start() {
        // Initialize with a default algorithm
        currentAlgorithm = new WeightedAlgorithm();
    }

    public void SpinWheel() {
        int winningNumber = currentAlgorithm.GetWinningNumber(recentSpins);
        recentSpins.Add(winningNumber);
        // Trigger animations and update UI
    }

    public void SwitchAlgorithm(ISpinAlgorithm newAlgorithm) {
        currentAlgorithm = newAlgorithm;
    }
}

2. BettingSystem.cs

Handles player bets, calculates winnings, and updates the player's balance.

public class BettingSystem : MonoBehaviour {
    public int playerBalance = 1000;

    public void PlaceBet(int amount, int numberBet) {
        // Deduct bet amount from player balance
        // Check if the bet wins and update balance accordingly
    }
}

3. MultiplayerManager.cs

Manages multiplayer sessions, including player matching and game state synchronization.

public class MultiplayerManager : MonoBehaviour {
    private bool isMultiplayerEnabled = true;

    void Start() {
        if (isMultiplayerEnabled) {
            // Initialize multiplayer session
        } else {
            // Start single-player mode
        }
    }
}

4. UIManager.cs

Controls UI elements like buttons, sliders, and text fields.

public class UIManager : MonoBehaviour {
    public Text balanceText;

    void UpdateBalanceDisplay(int newBalance) {
        balanceText.text = "Balance: " + newBalance.ToString();
    }
}

5. AdManager.cs

Handles AdMob integration for rewarded ads.

public class AdManager : MonoBehaviour {
    void Start() {
        // Initialize AdMob
    }

    public void ShowRewardedAd() {
        // Show rewarded ad
    }
}

🔄 Spin Algorithm Interface

public interface ISpinAlgorithm {
    int GetWinningNumber(List<int> recentSpins);
}

Implementations of this interface:

    WeightedAlgorithm: Favors numbers that haven't appeared recently.

    RandomBiasAlgorithm: Introduces a slight bias towards certain numbers.

    HotStreakAlgorithm: Increases probability for numbers that have appeared consecutively.

    EvenerAlgorithm: Balances the distribution of winning numbers over time.

    DelayedRepeatAlgorithm: Avoids repeating the last winning number immediately.

🎮 Multiplayer Logic

    Lobby System: Players can join a lobby and wait for an opponent.

    Matchmaking: If an opponent is found, the game starts; otherwise, the player can choose to play against the AI.

    Game State Sync: Ensure that both players see the same game state and that actions are synchronized.

    To integrate Firebase multiplayer functionality and AdMob rewarded ads into your Unity 3D roulette game, here's a structured approach:
🔗 Firebase Multiplayer Integration

To implement real-time multiplayer and matchmaking, you can utilize Firebase Realtime Database and Cloud Functions. Here's a step-by-step guide:

    Set Up Firebase in Unity:

        Follow the official Firebase Unity setup guide:
        Firebase

    Implement Matchmaking with Cloud Functions:

        Use Firebase Cloud Functions to handle matchmaking logic. For a detailed example, refer to this tutorial:
        Medium

    Sync Game State in Real-Time:

        Utilize Firebase Realtime Database to synchronize game state across players. This includes updating player positions, bets, and results.

    Handle Player Connections:

        Implement logic to manage player connections, disconnections, and game reconnections to ensure a seamless multiplayer experience.

🎮 AdMob Rewarded Ads Integration

To monetize your game using AdMob rewarded ads, follow these steps:

    Initialize the Mobile Ads SDK:

        In your Unity project, initialize the AdMob SDK:

    using GoogleMobileAds.Api;

    public class AdManager : MonoBehaviour
    {
        private RewardedAd rewardedAd;

        void Start()
        {
            MobileAds.Initialize(initStatus => { });
        }
    }

Load a Rewarded Ad:

    Load a rewarded ad using the following code:

    private void LoadRewardedAd()
    {
        string adUnitId = "your-ad-unit-id";
        rewardedAd = new RewardedAd(adUnitId);

        rewardedAd.OnAdLoaded += HandleRewardedAdLoaded;
        rewardedAd.OnAdFailedToLoad += HandleRewardedAdFailedToLoad;
        rewardedAd.LoadAd(new AdRequest.Builder().Build());
    }

    public void HandleRewardedAdLoaded(object sender, EventArgs args)
    {
        // Ad loaded successfully
    }

    public void HandleRewardedAdFailedToLoad(object sender, AdFailedToLoadEventArgs args)
    {
        // Handle ad load failure
    }

Show the Rewarded Ad:

    Display the ad when appropriate in your game:

    public void ShowRewardedAd()
    {
        if (rewardedAd.IsLoaded())
        {
            rewardedAd.Show();
        }
    }

Handle Ad Events:

    Implement event handlers to manage user rewards:

        rewardedAd.OnUserEarnedReward += HandleUserEarnedReward;

        public void HandleUserEarnedReward(object sender, Reward args)
        {
            // Reward the user
            int rewardAmount = args.Amount;
            string rewardType = args.Type;
        }

For a comprehensive guide, refer to the official AdMob documentation:
Google for Developers
